## ✅ Notes for Developers

- The app should prioritize usability for beginners, especially those new to stocks.
- Code modularity is important to allow switching between data providers or AI models.
- Streamlit or Dash can be evaluated for building the dashboard UI.
- Consider caching downloaded data to minimize API calls and improve speed.
- Logs should be user-readable and stored locally in `/logs`.
